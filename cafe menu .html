  <!--In this project, you will learn the basics of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) by building a cafe menu. CSS is the language used to style an HTML document. It describes how HTML elements should be displayed on the screen.As you learned in the last few steps of the Cat Photo App, there is a basic structure needed to start building your web page. Every HTML document should have a DOCTYPE declaration and html element. The DOCTYPE tells the browser which version of HTML the document is in. And the html element represents the root element which contains all other element. -->
  <html lang="en">
 <!--Add a head element within the html element, so you can add a title element. The title element's text should be Cafe Menu.-->
 <head><!--#Until now, you've had limited control over the presentation and appearance of your content. To change that, add a style element within the head element.-->
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
<link rel="stylesheet"  href="styles.css">
  <meta charset="utf-8">
 <!--#You can add style to an element by specifying it in the style element and setting a property for it like this:Center the content of the h1 element by setting its text-align property to the value center
 
# Now you need to link the styles.css file, so the styles will be applied again. Inside the head element, add a link element. Give it a rel attribute with the value of "stylesheet" and an href attribute with the value of "styles.css".Note that the link element is a void element.

 #In the previous step, you used a type selector to style the h1 element. Center the content of the h2 and the p elements by adding a new type selector for each one to the existing style element.
 #You have styled three elements by writing CSS inside the style tags. This works, but since there will be many more styles, it's best to put all the styles in a separate file and link to it.A separate styles.css file has been created for you. You can switch between files with the tabs at the top of the editor.Start by rewriting the styles you have created into the styles.css file. Make sure you exclude the opening and closing style tags.-->
 
 <title>Cafe Menu</title</head>
 <!--#The title is one of several elements that provide extra information not visible on the web page, but it is useful for search engines or how the page gets displayed.Inside the head element, nest a meta element with an attribute named charset set to the value utf-8 to tell the browser how to encode characters for the page.Remember that meta elements are void elements that require no ending tag.
 #To prepare to create some actual content, add a body element below the head element.-->
<body>
<!--#The div element is used mainly for design layout purposes, unlike the other content elements you have used so far. Add a div element inside the body element and then move all the other elements inside the new div.Inside the opening div tag, add the id attribute with a value of menu.
-->
<div class="menu">
<!--</11>#The goal now is to make the div not take up the entire width of the page. The CSS width property is perfect for this.You can use the id selector to target a specific element with an id attribute. An id selector is defined by placing the hash symbol # directly in front of the element's id value. For example, if an element has the id of cat then you would target that element like this:Use the #menu selector to give your element a width of 300px.

#It's time to add some menu content. Add a main element within the existing body element. It will eventually contain pricing information about coffee and desserts offered by the cafe.
-->
<main>
<h1>CAMPER CAFE</h1>

<!--#The name of the cafe is CAMPER CAFE. Add an h1 element within your main element. Give it the name of the cafe in capitalized letters to make it stand out.
#To let visitors know the cafe was founded in 2020, add a p element below the h1 element with the text Est. 2020
-->
<p class="established">Est. 2020</p>
<hr>
<!--#There will be two sections on the menu, one for coffees and one for desserts. Add a section element within the main element so you have a place to put all the coffees available.
-->

<!--#The flavors and prices are currently stacked on top of each other and centered with their respective p elements. It would be nice if the flavor was on the left and the price was on the right.Add the class name flavor to the French Vanilla p element.
#Create an h2 element in the section element and give it the text Coffee.
#You now have three type selectors with the same styling. You can add the same group of styles to many elements by creating a list of selectors. Each selector is separated with commas like this:Delete the three existing type selectors and replace them with one selector list that centers the text for the h1, h2, and p elements.
#Next, you want to center the #menu horizontally. You can do this by setting its margin-left and margin-right properties to auto. Think of the margin as an invisible space around an element. Using these two margin properties, center the #menu element within the body element.
#So far you have been using type and id selectors to style elements. However, it is more common to use a different selector to style your elements.A class selector is defined by a name with a dot directly in front of it, like this:Change the existing #menu selector into a class selector by replacing #menu with a class named .menu.
#To apply the class's styling to the div element, remove the id attribute and add a class attribute to the div element's opening tag. Make sure to set the class value to menu.
#Add an empty article element under the Coffee heading. It will contain a flavor and price of each coffee you currently offer.
#article elements commonly contain multiple elements that have related information. In this case, it will contain a coffee flavor and a price for that flavor.Nest two p elements inside your article element. The first one's text should be French Vanilla, and the second's text 3.00.
Starting below the existing coffee/price pair, add the following coffee and prices using article elements with two nested p elements inside each:As before, the first p element's text should contain the coffee flavor and the second p element's text should contain the price.-->
